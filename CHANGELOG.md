# Changelog

## v0.2.0

Coverage, scoping, and session resilience improvements across the pipeline.

- **Artifact location discovery** — orchestrator and research skill scan for existing artifacts before asking where to put them (#1)
- **Audit paths co-located with essays** — audit output moved from `docs/audits/` to `docs/essays/audits/` (#2)
- **Undecided territory detection** — build phase checks scenario-ADR coverage before starting, recognizes in-flight decision gaps, and verifies decision coverage at stewardship checkpoints (#3)
- **Scenario-to-module coverage check** — architect skill verifies work packages span all modules their claimed scenarios require (#5)
- **Solution scoping in discover gate** — agent proposes a solution shape, user reflects on completeness; feeds decide with full scope reference (#6)
- **Session management in build** — guidance for scoping sessions to one WP, re-reading artifacts on resume, recognizing context-loss drift (#6)
- **Orchestrator discoverable** — removed `disable-model-invocation` so the orchestrator can be suggested and can drive the pipeline
